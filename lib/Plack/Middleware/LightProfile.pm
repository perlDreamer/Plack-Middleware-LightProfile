=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::LightProfile - A small, lightweight profiler for time and memory as Plack middleware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Plack::Builder;
    use Log::Any;
    my $app = sub { ... };
    builder {
        enable "LightProfile";
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A little profiler for Plack applications.  All data is sent out over Log::Any at C<info> level.
A lot of this information is available in L<Plack::Middleware::Debug>, but this allows you to
aggregate it over all child processes at once.

These items are logged as a single log line:

=over

=item response time

How long did it take for the app to return a response.  This may include the time for other middleware wrapped by this.

=item end memory

After generating the current response, the amount of memory used by the current process.

=item added memory

How much memory was leaked (added) to the base process making the current response.
